{"name":"Vekna CMS","tagline":"Vekna CMS - next gen Java based content management system","body":"### Welcome to Vekna CMS.\r\nProject started with simple goal of providing simplest Content Management System based on Java (J2EE 6+), RestAPI, MongoDB (any db ultimately), angular.js, responsive HTML/CSS(5) tailored to be used by extremely non-technical users in government organizations across the world.\r\n\r\n### J2EE CMS seems excessive?\r\nBased on our experience, many government organizations run heavy server farms in order to support their massive systems for public record keeping, or data collection, or any other service they may need it for. (Sometimes, due to the stipulations of grants, they <b>have to</b> use enterprise solutions for applications)\r\n\r\nFor those type of organizations, they usually have to run another set of servers to provide \"web hosting\" service to the public or internally or both.\r\n\r\nWe looked toward answering this question: Why do we need to duplicate this effort of having 2 or more application server infrastructures in order to provide simple web site access to internal and external (public) users.\r\n\r\nIn .gov workforce, due to low wages compared to private sector, talent is not as abundantly available or as skilled thus creating a nightmare scenario that one or the other infrastructure will suffer below standard support.\r\nYes, everyone shouts - SharePoint, or ... (insert your favorite insanely expensive, difficult to maintain hosting solution). \r\n\r\nAnswer to you is NO. There is NO NEED in 90% of cases to go that route.\r\n\r\nVekna CMS is what we envision as an answer to the above questions.\r\n\r\n### Simple \"Corporate/Business/Government\" Style Web Site\r\nFor all smaller offices, organizations and in the end, even larger ones, VeknaCMS should be enough to fill 90% of their real needs. \r\n\r\nHire a designer (or have one in-house), have him/her create responsive template(s), upload them to your VeknaCMS, mark areas on page to their respective functionalities, and start hosting.\r\n\r\nIdea is to have as seamless and light process as possible to get the site AND content not only live, but logically and simply organized. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor and lead on this project is Igor Hrustic (@vadmin) who has a long history of working with various CMSes.
