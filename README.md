Vekna CMS - next gen Java based content management system

Goals

VERY simple to use for non-technical users. Some user-type granularity, NO user registration per-se, but management part should be allowed with several levels.

Target audience are shops where technical people are scarce but information amount is fairly large. Mostly government and education organizations (city/county/state/federal).

System should allow for very easy change of look and feel using basic HTML/CSS changes, without coding.

Open API should allow for connectors to various content providers using standard authentication instruments. Think SharePoint, or PeopleSoft connectors.

Java based RestAPI middleware, angular.js, and modern css styling (bootstrap) with MongoDB as backend, should be a fun ride.
